Example of a long text passage:
"It was a dark and stormy night. The wind howled through the trees, and the rain pounded against the windows of the old mansion. Inside, a small group of people huddled together, listening to the sounds of the storm outside.
Suddenly, there was a loud crash, and the lights went out. The group gasped in fear, wondering what had happened. One brave soul ventured outside to investigate, but quickly returned with a look of terror on their face.
'It's the tree,' they said. 'It's fallen across the power lines. We're trapped here until someone can come and fix it.'
The group settled in for a long night, trying to stay warm and dry as the storm raged on. They told stories, played games, and tried to pass the time as best they could. But as the hours dragged on, they couldn't help but feel a sense of unease.
Something was out there in the darkness, something they couldn't see or hear. Was it a wild animal? A ghost? Or something even more sinister?
As the night wore on, the group became increasingly paranoid, jumping at every sound and imagining all sorts of horrors lurking just beyond their sight. But eventually, the storm subsided, and the sun began to rise.
Relieved and exhausted, the group emerged from the mansion, blinking in the light of the new day. They looked back at the old house, shrouded in mist and mystery, and wondered what other secrets it held".
